# Memory Recorder

The purpose of this application is to act as a platform for users to digitally record their memories and thoughts. Despite being widespread, issues with memory loss are often not accommodated for. The features of this application are meant to help assist with memory retention.

## Usage
### Login

Here users have the option to login with existing credentials, register a new account, or go through the process of password recovery.

`Note`: The "Forgot password?" option is currently unavailable.

Upon logging in the user is  brought to the “Account” section of the “Dashboard” page. This page displays all user information with options to edit that information.

The “emergency contact” section provides the user with quick access to contact information for help if they are in need.

`Note`: The thought process behind this is that an individual with memory loss issues might be having a medical emergency and not know who to contact.
